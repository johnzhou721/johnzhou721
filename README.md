----------
- Favorite Operation System: Fedora GNU/Linux KDE Plasma Desktop Edition (although I'm on a Mac usually, just to separate personal life and school stuff.  I run a VM using UTM.  I distrohop.)
- Favorite Programming Language: (La)TeX
- Favorite (anti)-Pattern: Factories
- Least Favorite Operating System: Microsoft Windows
- Favorite app frameworks: Qt, Cocoa
- Least Favorite Companies (from worst to less bad): Microsoft, Apple, Google, Adobe (good software, proprietary though and sues users of old versions), Disney (I like Disney movies, am fine with copyright -- but not their usage of UHD Blu-Rays which uses [DRM](https://www.defectivebydesign.org/)), Autodesk, SpaceX (I don't like how they're making money out of publicly available space, even though I'm sort of sad that their 9th test flight has lost attitude control just as I'm committing this now), Amazon (CEO giving up on being a theoretical physicist because of a problem (pun intended) and funded the dirty Amazon with bad business practices, also Kindle DRM, yuck)
- Favorite Movie: Frozen (2013) ‚ùÑÔ∏è  (ironic because this is a Disney movie, I don't like Disney the company, and I'm a boy.)
- Favorite Markup Language: LaTeX
- Favorite 3D Shape: Frustum
- Favorite Icon on macOS: Recycle Bin (Trash)
- Favorite Apple Platform: iOS (also advertised as iPadOS.  Yes they are the same operating system)
- Favorite Piece of Free Software: GNU Gettext (changed on Oct 7.  The old one here is Autotools, the main thing about these two is that even minor versions have incompatible changes, however that does not affect my love for them)
- Favorite Build System: GNU Make (like Makefiles.)
- Least Favorite Build System: Xcode  (Always so laggy!  I use it as a text editor mainly (because it auto-associates all code files), I open a file and it takes 6--7 seconds!)
- Favorite Region: Yunnan, China
- Favorite Name for New Folders (that often remains that name for awhile): untitled folder (insert number here)
- Favorite Free Software Project (for now): BeeWare
- Favorite Large Organization: FSF
